I don't want to take what you can give...I would rather starve than eat your bread...I would rather run but I can't walk...Guess I'll lie alone just like before...I'll take the varmint's path...oh, and I must refuse your test. Push me and I will resist...this behavior's not unique. I don't want to hear from those who know...They can buy, but can't put on my clothes...I don't want to limp for them to walk...Never would have known of me before...I don't want to be held in your debt...I'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed...I'm already cut up and half dead...I'll end up alone like I began...Everything has chains...absolutely nothing's changed ",
